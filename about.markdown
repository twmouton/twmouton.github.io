I am Thomas Mouton and I've been into writing software in various forms for nearly two decades. I started in middle school attempting to automate aspects of computer games (read cheating) and that spiraled into an interest much larger in both building new things as well as taking others apart.

I've created this space to help me organize my thoughts and give me an outlet to share with others. The primary subjects are software engineering, c++, and reverse engineering. It'll also touch on operating systems internals, assembly, writing performant code, compilers and probably a few posts that are pure pontification.

If you have any questions or want to get in touch, I'm not hard to find. I lurk on twitter, hacker-news, reddit, and stack-overflow as well as obviously this github account which will be publishing much more code publically to go along with posts. If all else fails, email.
